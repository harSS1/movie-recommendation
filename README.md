## Movie Recommendation App

## About:
Are you spending hours trying to pick a movie to watch? This web application helps you find movies by swiping left or right and saves movies based on your preferences. You can view more details about each movie, and once you've watched one, you can easily remove it from your watchlist.

The application uses the TMDB (The Movie Database) API to fetch movie data and stores your watchlist locally in the browser using LocalStorage. It is built with React, Vite, and styled using Tailwind CSS.
